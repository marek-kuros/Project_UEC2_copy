----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top/u_ball_control/fly_E_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top/u_ball_control/fly_E_reg/L3_2/O, cell u_top/u_ball_control/fly_E_reg/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top/u_ball_control/fly_NE_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top/u_ball_control/fly_NE_reg_i_2/O, cell u_top/u_ball_control/fly_NE_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
