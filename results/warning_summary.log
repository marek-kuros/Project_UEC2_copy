----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top/u_select_game_sm/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top/u_select_game_sm/rgb_nxt_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell u_top/u_select_game_sm/rgb_nxt_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
